🏙️ CivicFix – Smart Civic Issue Management System

CivicFix is a web-based platform that simplifies how citizens report and track civic issues. It acts as a digital bridge between the public and civic authorities, ensuring transparency, accountability, and faster resolution of problems faced in daily life.

Citizens can easily register, log in, and submit complaints related to public infrastructure such as roads 🚧, water supply 💧, electricity ⚡, and sanitation 🧹. Each complaint is securely stored and can be tracked in real time. Administrators manage all complaints through a centralized dashboard, assign issues to the appropriate technicians or departments, and update the status until resolution.

Built using modern web technologies, CivicFix focuses on user-friendly design, role-based access control, and efficient backend processing, making it a practical solution for e-governance and smart city initiatives 🌆.
